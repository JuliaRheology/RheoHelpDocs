# RheoHelpDocs

This repository contains documents which introduce the documentation, testing and versioning systems used in RHEOS. The repository contains both *.tex and *.pdf versions of the documents.

## DocumentationGuide

Explanation of the documentation system used by RHEOS. It should function as a convenient reference guide when making updates to the documentation. Local and remote aspects are covered.

## TestingGuide

Explanation of the testing framework used by RHEOS. It demonstrates how to add new tests, run tests locally and debug testing failures that occur on the remote servers during the CI stage.

## VersioningGuide

Explanation of the versioning procedure of RHEOS. Most importantly: how to create a new version of RHEOS, describe its dependencies, and submit to the Julia central package repository.
