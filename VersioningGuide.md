    This document is a short explanation of how the RHEOS versioning
    procedure works, and how it relates to documentation, CI testing and the
    RHEOS central package repository.

Basic Versioning Procedure
==========================

Tools and their Use
-------------------

The basic versioning procedure relies on the following three components:
the
[Project.toml](https://github.com/JuliaRheology/RHEOS.jl/blob/master/Project.toml)
file that lives in the RHEOS root directory, the [Julia TagBot GitHub
app](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/TagBot), and the [JuliaTeam
Registrator GitHub
app](https://github.com/JuliaRegistries/Registrator.jl).\
The above components are used for RHEOS versioning in the following way.
A number of changes are made to RHEOS directly to the master branch, at
some point it will make sense to release a new version. When this moment
arrives, a final commit should be made that contains an updated
Project.toml file. The information added to the Project.toml commit is
the version number (for example
[`version = "0.9.2"`]{style="background-color: light-light-gray"} at
time of writing) and any compatibility information (e.g. the version(s)
of Julia that the package is compatible with and any specific version
numbers required of dependencies). For information on exactly how this
information should be formatted in the Project.toml file, see [this
link](https://julialang.github.io/Pkg.jl/v1/compatibility/index.html).
**IMPORTANT NOTE: The Julia versions which the package is specified to
be compatible with should be in the CI testing matrix on Linux and
Windows and should be passing, see
sectionÂ [2](#sec:TC){reference-type="ref" reference="sec:TC"} for more
info**. After this commit is pushed, you need to navigate to that commit
in GitHub by going to the main RHEOS page, clicking commits, and then on
the relevant commit. You can then invoke the JuliaRegistrator bot by
creating a comment saying
[`@JuliaRegistrator register()`]{style="background-color: light-light-gray"},
as for example [this
link](https://github.com/JuliaRheology/RHEOS.jl/commit/e2e63c299615a32ab2d7e055484b3efc662544c4).
This will create a pull request on the Julia central package repositry.
**You do not need to manually tag the release, this will be done
automatically by the Julia TagBot app.**\
So a high level overview is the following:

-   Make changes on master branch, add tests as necessary and make sure
    all tests are passing in required Julia versions

-   When a version is ready to be finalised, update Project.toml, then
    commit

-   Invoke Registrator.jl which pushes necessary information to the
    central package repository

-   TagBot will then automatically create a release on the RHEOS
    repository

**Note:** it is best practice to update the testing matrix as soon as
possible, so that the appropriate versions of Julia are being tested on
*during development*.

Version Number Guidelines
-------------------------

There is some debate in the programming community as to the best version
numbering system. Generally speaking, for version X.Y.Z, an increment in
Z is a minor update which contains small changes and bug-fixes. An
increment in Y would contain one or more new features. Finally, an
increment in X could be a major update which significantly changes the
way users interact with the program, e.g. major syntax changes.
Agreement should be sought with main commiters before a version is
finalised. For now, we should try and follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0,
a description of which can be found at <https://semver.org/>.

Testing Considerations {#sec:TC}
======================

As described in the testing documentation, the RHEOS github repository
is set up with Travis CI and Appveyor to automatically run tests on
Linux and Windows servers respectively. If any of the tests fail, this
will be indicated on the appropriate badge in the github repository
README page.\
**If we make changes in the Project.toml file saying that the package is
compatible with particular version(s) of Julia then all RHEOS tests
should be passing on those versions of Julia. Generally we will want
compatibility on as many Julia versions as is practically feasible.**\
For an example of how to specify which version of Julia RHEOS will be
tested on, you can check the
[appveyor.yml](https://github.com/JuliaRheology/RHEOS.jl/blob/master/appveyor.yml)
and
[.travis.yml](https://github.com/JuliaRheology/RHEOS.jl/blob/master/.travis.yml)
in the RHEOS repository, or many other Julia packages.

Relation to Documentation
=========================

Documenter.jl will make a version of the documentation for each version
of RHEOS. The most recent release of RHEOS is considered the 'stable'
documentation and the current master branch build is the 'dev'
documentation. There is a link to both versions on the RHEOS readme
page. For more information on this, see the Documenter.jl documentation,
or [this link more specifically under the section 'Documentation
Versions'](https://juliadocs.github.io/Documenter.jl/stable/man/hosting/).
